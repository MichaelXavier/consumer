Description:

  Creates request and response classes. 
  
  The first argument is the name of the request class *without* the word
  "Request" at the end. This is added automatically. i.e. "UPSRate" would
  generate the UPSRateRequest class.
  
  The second (optional) argument is for the response class, and no name
  trickery here - you get what you say. It defaults to the first argument,
  so if that was "UPSRate", a UPSRate class would be created as the
  response object (and UPSRateRequest would return UPSRate object(s)).
  
Usage:

  script/generate request ShortRequestClass [ResponseClass=ShortRequestClass]
  
  ex. script/generate request UPSRate Rate
  => generates UPSRateRequest, which returns Rate objects, and generates
     the Rate class.
