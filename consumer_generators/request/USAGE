Description:

  Creates request and response classes. 
  
  The first argument is the name of the request class *without* the word
  "Request" at the end. This is added automatically. i.e. "UPSRate" would
  generate the UPSRateRequest class.
  
  The second (optional) argument is for the response class, and no name
  trickery here - you get what you say. It defaults to the first argument,
  so if that was "UPSRate", a UPSRate class would be created as the
  response object (and UPSRateRequest would return UPSRate object(s)).
  
Usage:

  script/generate request ShortRequestClass [ResponseClass=ShortRequestClass]
  
  ex. script/generate request UPSRate Rate
  => generates UPSRateRequest, which returns Rate objects, and generates
     the Rate class and specs.
     
  You should definitely look at the specs, and use DO_IT_LIVE (shown in specs) to
  get started configuring the request. Once it gets back the kind of xml you want,
  put it in the generated (empty) xml file and use that to configure the response
  class with canned data. test one more time live, script/generate again, rinse, repeat.
