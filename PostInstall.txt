About Consumer:

  Consumer creates an empty ready-for-rails gem primed for consuming xml resources
  via Builder, libxml, and some request sending / response marshaling glue.
  
  Also comes with a generator for making the request/response classes, config files,
  and specs (see script/generate after creating the gem).
  
Getting Started:
  
  execute:
  
  consumer your_gem_name
  cd your_gem_name
  script/generate request
  
  The last command should help you get rolling.
